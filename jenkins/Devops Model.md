## **3. DevOps Model Approach**

DevOps **extends Agile** by automating development, testing, and deployment.

### **Example Execution:**

1. **Sprint 1 (Week 1-2) - Product Listing + CI/CD Setup**
    
    - A **basic product listing page** is developed.
    - **Continuous Integration (CI)** is implemented: Whenever a developer pushes code, automated tests run immediately.
    - The code is automatically deployed to a **test environment**.
2. **Sprint 2 (Week 3-4) - Shopping Cart + Auto Deployment**
    
    - The shopping cart feature is developed.
    - **Continuous Deployment (CD)** is added, allowing **automatic updates** to production without manual intervention.
3. **Sprint 3 (Week 5-6) - Payment + Infrastructure as Code**
    
    - Payment system is integrated.
    - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is used to automate cloud deployment (e.g., AWS, Azure).
    - Scaling and security monitoring are automated.
4. **Sprint 4 (Week 7-8) - Launch with Monitoring & Security**
    
    - The site is launched with **automated monitoring** (e.g., logs, performance tracking).
    - **Chaos Monkey (Netflix Simian Army)** is introduced to **test system failures and resilience**.
    - DevOps ensures updates are **deployed multiple times per day**, if needed.

### **Advantages of DevOps Over Agile:**

- **Fully automated** deployment, testing, and monitoring.
- **Faster delivery** – new updates are deployed **multiple times a day** instead of once per sprint.
- **Less human error** – automation reduces deployment failures.
- **Scalability** – can handle millions of users without manual setup.

## **Final Comparison: Waterfall vs. Agile vs. DevOps (With Online Shopping Example)**

|Feature|Waterfall|Agile|DevOps|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Development Time**|9-12 months|2-3 months|1-2 months (automated)|
|**Customer Feedback**|Late-stage|Frequent|Real-time|
|**Deployment Frequency**|Once per project|Once per sprint|Multiple times per day|
|**Automation**|No|Partial|High (CI/CD, IaC, Monitoring)|
|**Risk of Failure**|High|Moderate|Low|
|**Flexibility to Change**|Very low|High|Very high|
|**Scalability**|Difficult|Moderate|Easy (Cloud & Automation)|

### **Conclusion**

- **Waterfall** is outdated, **too slow**, and **too rigid** for modern software.
- **Agile** is faster and more flexible but lacks automation for deployment.
- **DevOps** is the best for modern applications as it provides **speed, automation, and reliability**.

### **1. Plan**

**Objective:** Define project goals, requirements, and workflows.

- Teams collaborate to **identify features, user stories, and system architecture**.
- Tools like **JIRA, Trello, and Confluence** help manage tasks and roadmaps.
- Planning ensures **clarity and alignment** between developers, operations, and business teams.

---

### **2. Develop**

**Objective:** Write and manage code efficiently.

- Developers write code in small, manageable units.
- **Version control systems** like **Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)** track changes.
- **Branching strategies** like **GitFlow** help in structured code development.
- **Code review processes** ensure high-quality code before merging.

---

### **3. Build**

**Objective:** Compile, package, and prepare the code for deployment.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** automates the process of merging code.
- Tools like **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI** build the software automatically.
- Automated **dependency management** ensures compatibility and avoids conflicts.
- If errors occur, developers are notified immediately to fix them.

---

### **4. Test**

**Objective:** Ensure the software is bug-free and meets quality standards.

- **Automated testing** tools like **Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Postman** execute tests.
- Types of testing:
    - **Unit Testing** – Checks individual functions or modules.
    - **Integration Testing** – Ensures different modules work together.
    - **Performance Testing** – Checks system speed under load.
    - **Security Testing** – Identifies vulnerabilities.
- **Shift-left testing** ensures early-stage bug detection.

---

### **5. Release**

**Objective:** Ensure the code is ready for production deployment.

- The software is **packaged and versioned** using tools like **Docker, Helm, and Nexus**.
- **Feature flags** allow enabling/disabling new features without redeployment.
- Approval processes ensure only **stable and tested** releases go live.
- **Rollback mechanisms** are prepared in case of issues.

---

### **6. Deploy**

**Objective:** Automatically deploy applications to production environments.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates releases using **Jenkins, ArgoCD, GitOps**.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like **Terraform and Ansible** automate cloud setups.
- **Kubernetes** manages containerized applications for **scalability and resilience**.
- **Blue-Green and Canary deployments** allow safe rollouts with minimal downtime.

---

### **7. Operate**

**Objective:** Ensure smooth operation of the application in a live environment.

- **System monitoring** with tools like **Prometheus, Datadog, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**.
- **Incident management** using **PagerDuty, Opsgenie** to handle failures quickly.
- **Auto-scaling** ensures performance under varying loads.
- **Database management** with backups and optimizations.

---

### **8. Monitor & Feedback**

**Objective:** Track performance, detect issues, and improve future development.

- **Real-time monitoring** of logs, errors, and user experience.
- **Observability tools** like **Grafana, New Relic, AWS CloudWatch** track application health.
- **AI-based predictive analytics** prevent failures before they occur.
- **User feedback loops** help prioritize future features and fixes.
