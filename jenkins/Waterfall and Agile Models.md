## Waterfall Model

- So basically waterfall model is a type of model where the entire project is first done and later the feedbacks are taken. 
- Here the website is ready only after certain stages

## Agile Model

- Here the project is broken down into small functionalities and the functionality built is immediately shown to client for feedback and changes are made
- the cycle of building functionality and reviewing it is called a `sprint`.

## **1. Waterfall Model Approach**

In the Waterfall model, the project follows a strict sequence of steps.
1. **Requirement Gathering (Month 1-2)**
    
    - Business team collects requirements like product listing, cart, checkout, and payment features.
    - Once finalized, no changes can be made easily.
2. **System Design (Month 3-4)**
    
    - The architecture, database schema, and user interface (UI) are designed.
    - Developers and designers plan the entire system before coding begins.
3. **Development (Month 5-8)**
    
    - Developers write the entire code based on the initial plan.
    - No working product is available until all coding is done.
4. **Testing (Month 9-10)**
    
    - The testing team checks for bugs, performance issues, and security flaws.
    - If major issues are found, development needs to go back, causing delays.
5. **Deployment (Month 11)**
    
    - The complete website is launched **after almost a year**.
    - If the market changes during this time, adapting is difficult.

### **Problems with the Waterfall Model:**

- If customer feedback suggests changes, **major redesigns** are needed.
- Deployment happens **only once**, leading to **high risk of failure**.
- Takes a **long time** before users see any results.

## **2. Agile Model Approach**

Agile divides the project into **small sprints** (2-4 weeks each) with frequent releases and feedback.

### **Example Execution:**

1. **Sprint 1 (Week 1-2) - Product Listing Page**
    
    - Developers and designers create a **basic product listing** page with a simple UI.
    - A working prototype is shown to the business team for feedback.
    - Changes are made immediately based on feedback.
2. **Sprint 2 (Week 3-4) - Shopping Cart Feature**
    
    - The cart feature is developed and tested.
    - Customers can now **add products to the cart** and view them.
    - New feedback is collected, and improvements are made.
3. **Sprint 3 (Week 5-6) - Payment Integration**
    
    - Basic payment options like **credit card and PayPal** are added.
    - Security checks and testing happen simultaneously.
4. **Sprint 4 (Week 7-8) - Launch & Improvements**
    
    - The **first version of the website is launched** with core features.
    - Additional features like **discounts, search filters, and order tracking** are added in later sprints.

### **Advantages of Agile Over Waterfall:**

- Customers can use a **working product early**.
- Continuous feedback allows for **quick improvements**.
- Developers can **change priorities** based on market trends.

### **Limitations of Agile:**

- Agile **only focuses on development**, **not deployment and operations**.
- **Deploying and managing updates manually** can still be time-consuming.
